 node --zero-fill-buffers

 then use Buffer.allocUnsafe(10);

 It will fill the buffer with Zero

What makes `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` and `Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow()` "unsafe"?#
When calling Buffer.allocUnsafe() and Buffer.allocUnsafeSlow(), the segment of allocated memory is uninitialized (it is not zeroed-out). While this design makes the allocation of memory quite fast, the allocated segment of memory might contain old data that is potentially sensitive. Using a Buffer created by Buffer.allocUnsafe() without completely overwriting the memory can allow this old data to be leaked when the Buffer memory is read.

While there are clear performance advantages to using Buffer.allocUnsafe(), extra care must be taken in order to avoid introducing security vulnerabilities into an application.
